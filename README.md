# Reworked source code of CyberVal

Credits go to: all turkish/spanish pasters and to zeroday-z for the complete dead code.

I'm posting my rework from CyberVal because I don't currently have an injector for a current windows version and the project is gathering dust on my computer.

If you have questions, just use the Issues Page.

# Offsets outdated?

I update the offsets here when I have time and feel like it. The current version is tested on Valorant 4.01...
The state+key is updated for 4.02 but never tested.
