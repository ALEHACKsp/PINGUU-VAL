# Reworked source code of CyberVal

Credits go to: all turkish/spanish pasters and to zeroday-z for the complete dead code.

I'm posting my rework from CyberVal because I don't currently have an injector for a current windows version and the project is gathering dust on my computer.

If you have questions, just use the Issues Page.

# Offsets outdated?

I update the offsets here when I have time and feel like it. The current version is tested on Valorant 4.01...

The state+key is updated for 4.02 but never tested. 

# Injector

Use what you want, if you don't have a injector use this detected face injector

-> Works only for Windows 1803, 1809 !!
