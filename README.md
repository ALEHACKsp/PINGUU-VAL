# CyberVal

CyberVal is a paste of a internal Valorant Cheat which has been used by several providers like **LeagueHell**, **Enduty** and several other pasted chairs.

## Information
This code is absolute trash, and likely will need some fixxing. 

## Installation

Use VS2021/22 to compile this cheat and use my [CyberantInjector](https://github.com/zeroday-z/CyberAntLoader) to inject this cheat into the game. If you don't know how to inject, dont try it.

## Credits
Credits go to: all turkish/spanish pasters and to **zeroday-z** for fixxing the source and leaking it.
